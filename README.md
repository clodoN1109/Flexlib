Flexlib is being designed of the frustration of trying to organize a digital library using traditional operating system file systems. While folders and filenames offer a basic form of organization, they quickly become cumbersome and inflexible when you need to:

    Classify items using multiple properties (e.g. author, theme, rating)

    Search and filter items by attributes

    Reorganize the structure of your library dynamically

    Add comments and create references between items, across a single or multiple libraries.

Flexlib introduces a structured yet flexible model with an intuitive and minimalistic sintax for managing physical or digital collections â€” whether they consist of books, PDFs, videos, or any kind of media. Rather than relying on rigid directory structures, Flexlib treats your collection as a queryable, shapeable dataset, allowing you to define property-based views and nested layouts.
